# 🔐 Polymorphic Obfuscation Demo  

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **proof-of-concept educational tool** that demonstrates the concept of **polymorphic code obfuscation** in Python.  

Polymorphism in code means that the same functionality can be represented in many different forms. This is often studied in **cybersecurity and malware analysis**, since attackers use it to avoid detection.  

⚠️ In this project, the payload is **completely harmless** — it only prints a friendly message. The goal is purely **educational and safe**.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. 📝 Start with a simple Python payload (harmless).  
2. 📦 Compress + 🔡 Base64 encode the payload.  
3. 🔑 Apply a random XOR key for obfuscation.  
4. 🌀 Generate a new Python script that looks different every time but runs the same original payload.  

➡️ Each generated script is **polymorphic** — its code changes form but produces the same output.  

---

## 🧩 Example Payload  
```python
def harmless_function():
    print("Hello from the polymorphic demo! 👋")

harmless_function()
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polymorphic-obfuscation-demo.git
cd polymorphic-obfuscation-demo
```

### 2. Run the script:

polymorphic_obfuscation.py

### 3. ✅ A new obfuscated script will be generated and executed.
